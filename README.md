## About the Game 

Unicorn Mazer first version was made in 2019, only with Python and Pygame.
The game was a personal project, designed pixel by pixel in the hardest way.
A new (and much better) version was developed in 2020, using object-oriented programming. 

All pixel art of the game was made by myself in the pixel art tool: https://www.pixilart.com/
All game musics and sound effects were free obtained from the website https://freesound.org/
